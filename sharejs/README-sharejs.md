Sharejs in Morgue
----

Gonna try to see if we can use sharejs enable collaborative editing of the morgue documents.

start with npm:
```
npm install share@"<0.7.0"
npm install connect@"<2.0.0"
```

Start the service
```
node app.js
```

## Adding EpicEditor

EpicEditor is a WYSIWG browser based markdown editor
which seems like a good step up from morgue's markdown
editing.  Hopefully we can get sharejs working with 
this editor.
